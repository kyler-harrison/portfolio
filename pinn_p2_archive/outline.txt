quick recap of p1, link to p1

state new problem: solve H atom with PINN approach

formalize loss terms and approach

first few tries, different net variations

best results

other attempts, problems with current approaches (trivial soln., unstable solns, stiff solns)
are good results handpicked? how to consistently get good results? 

what now? can this work? to be continued?
